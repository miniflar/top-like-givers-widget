A [Flarum](http://flarum.org) extension. Top Like Givers in the past month Widget.

Why top like givers and not receivers? Simply because it's a statistic that no one bothers to consider as forum activity. 

If we're honest, liking a post does count as much towards forum activity as the posts receiving those likes. It takes effort to smash that like button in a discussion!

You probably think I'm crazy and might pass up on installing this extension, but what if I told you that your users that go on liking sprees could _like_ the fact that they are being noticed for actively reading your forum content? ðŸ˜‰

Besides, a liked post can mean that a user read some if not most of a forum post and could not offer a reply at the time (it relieves the pressure of feeling as if they _NEED_ to reply).

__Note:__ Regarding the interval to when the widget statistics update, it will update [every 10 minutes](https://github.com/miniflar/top-like-givers-widget/blob/main/src/LikeRepository.php#L32) and will possibly be configurable in the future.

## Installation

This will also install [Forum Widgets Core](https://github.com/afrux/forum-widgets-core) as it relies on it.
